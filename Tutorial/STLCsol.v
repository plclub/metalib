(** An interactive tutorial on developing programming language
    metatheory.  This file uses the simply-typed lambda calculus
    (STLC) to demonstrate the locally nameless representation of
    lambda terms and cofinite quantification in judgments.

    This tutorial concentrates on "how" to formalize STLC; for more
    details about "why" we use this style of development see:

(** * Syntax of STLC *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** We use a locally nameless representation for the simply-typed
    lambda calculus, where bound variables are represented as natural
    numbers (de Bruijn indices) and free variables are represented as
    [atom]s.

    The type [atom], defined in the MetatheoryAtom library, represents
    names.  Equality on names is decidable ([eq_atom_dec]), and it is
    possible to generate an atom fresh for any given finite set of
    atoms ([atom_fresh]).
*)

Inductive typ : Set :=
  | typ_base  : typ
  | typ_arrow : typ -> typ -> typ.

Inductive exp : Set :=
  | bvar : nat  -> exp
  | fvar : atom -> exp
  | abs  : typ -> exp  -> exp
  | app  : exp  -> exp -> exp.

Coercion bvar : nat >-> exp.
Coercion fvar : atom >-> exp.

(** We declare the constructors for indices and variables to be
    coercions.  That way, if Coq sees a [nat] where it expects an
    [exp], it will implicitly insert an application of [bvar]; and
    similarly for [atom]s.

    For example, we can encode the expression (\x:b. Y x) as below.
    Because "Y" is free variable in this term, we need to assume an
    atom for this name.
*)

Parameter Y : atom.
Definition demo_rep1 := abs typ_base (app Y 0).

(** Note that because of the coercions we may write [abs (app Y 0)]
    instead of [abs (app (fvar Y) (bvar 0))].

    Below is another example: the encoding of (\x:b. \y:b. (y x)).
*)

Definition demo_rep2 := abs typ_base (abs typ_base (app 0 1)).


(** Exercise: Uncomment and then complete the definitions of the following
	 lambda calculus terms using the locally nameless representation.

       "two"     :    \s:b->b. \z:b. s (s z)

       "COMB_K"  :    \x:b. \y:b. x

       "COMB_S"  :    \x:b -> b -> b.\y:b -> b.\z:b. x z (y z)

*)


Definition two :=
  (* SOLUTION *)
  abs (typ_arrow typ_base typ_base)
                      (abs typ_base (app 1 (app 1 0))).

Definition COMB_K :=
  (* SOLUTION *)
	abs typ_base
    (abs typ_base 1).

Definition COMB_S :=
   (* SOLUTION *)
   abs (typ_arrow typ_base (typ_arrow typ_base typ_base))
    (abs (typ_arrow typ_base typ_base)
      (abs (typ_base)
        (app (app 2 0) (app 1 0)))).


(** There are two important advantages of the locally nameless
    representation:
     - Alpha-equivalent terms have a unique representation.
       We're always working up to alpha-equivalence.
     - Operations such as free variable substitution and free
       variable calculation have simple recursive definitions
       (and therefore are simple to reason about).

    Weighed against these advantages are two drawbacks:
     - The [exp] datatype admits terms, such as [abs 3], where
       indices are unbound.
       A term is called "locally closed" when it contains
       no unbound indices.
     - We must define *both* bound variable & free variable
       substitution and reason about how these operations
       interact with each other.
*)


(*************************************************************************)
(** * Substitution *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** Substitution replaces a free variable with a term.  The definition
    below is simple for two reasons:
      - Because bound variables are represented using indices, there
        is no need to worry about variable capture.
      - We assume that the term being substituted in is locally
        closed.  Thus, there is no need to shift indices when
        passing under a binder.
*)

Fixpoint subst (z : atom) (u : exp) (e : exp)
  {struct e} : exp :=
  match e with
    | bvar i => bvar i
    | fvar x => if x == z then u else (fvar x)
    | abs t e1 => abs t (subst z u e1)
    | app e1 e2 => app (subst z u e1) (subst z u e2)
  end.

(** The [Fixpoint] keyword defines a Coq function.  As all functions
    in Coq must be total.  The annotation [{struct e}] indicates the
    termination metric---all recursive calls in this definition are
    made to arguments that are structurally smaller than [e].

    Note also that subst uses the notation [x == z] for decidable atom
    equality.  This notation is defined in the Metatheory library.

    We define a notation for free variable substitution that mimics
    standard mathematical notation.
*)

Notation "[ z ~> u ] e" := (subst z u e) (at level 68).


(** To demonstrate how free variable substitution works, we need to
    reason about atom equality.
*)

Parameter Z : atom.
(* Check (Y == Z). *)

(** The decidable atom equality function returns a sum. If the two
    atoms are equal, the left branch of the sum is returned, carrying
    a proof of the proposition that the atoms are equal.  If they are
    not equal, the right branch includes a proof of the disequality.

    The demo below uses three new tactics:
    - The tactic [simpl] reduces a Coq expression to its normal
      form.
    - The tactic [destruct (Y==Y)] considers the two possible
      results of the equality test.
    - The tactic [Case] marks cases in the proof script.
      It takes any string as its argument, and puts that string in
      the hypothesis list until the case is finished.
*)

Lemma demo_subst1:
  [Y ~> Z] (abs typ_base (app 0 Y)) = (abs typ_base (app 0 Z)).
Proof.
  simpl.
  destruct (Y==Y).
  Case "left".

(** Take-home Exercise: We can use almost the same proof script as
    above to state how substitution works in the variable case. Try it
    on your own.  *)

(*************************************************************************)
(** * Free variables *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** The function [fv], defined below, calculates the set of free
    variables in an expression.  Because we are using a locally
    nameless representation, where bound variables are represented as
    indices, any name we see is a free variable of a term.  In
    particular, this makes the [abs] case simple.
*)

Fixpoint fv (e : exp) {struct e} : atoms :=
  match e with
    | bvar i => empty
    | fvar x => singleton x
    | abs t e1 => fv e1
    | app e1 e2 => (fv e1) `union` (fv e2)
  end.

(** The type [atoms] represents a finite set of elements of type
    [atom].  The notation for infix union is defined in the Metatheory
    library.
*)

(* Demo [f_equal]

  The tactic [f_equal] converts a goal of the form [f e1 = f e1'] in
  to one of the form [e1 = e1'], and similarly for [f e1 e2 = f e1'
  e2'], etc.
*)

(* Demo [fsetdec]

   The tactic [fsetdec] solves a certain class of propositions
   involving finite sets. See the documentation in [FSetWeakDecide]
   for a full specification.
*)

Lemma fsetdec_demo : forall (x :atom) (S : atoms),
  x `in` (singleton x `union` S).
Proof.
  fsetdec.
Qed.

(** Exercise [subst_fresh]
    To show the ease of reasoning with these definitions, we will prove a
    standard result from lambda calculus: if a variable does not
    appear free in a term, then substituting for it has no effect.

    HINTS: Prove this lemma by induction on [e].

    - You will need to use [simpl] in many cases.  You can [simpl]
      everything everywhere (including hypotheses) with the
      pattern [simpl in *].

    - Part of this proof includes a false assumption about free
      variables.  Destructing this hypothesis produces a goal about
      finite set membership that is solvable by [fsetdec].
*)

   This proof actually is very automatable ([simpl in *; auto.] takes
   care of all but the fvar case), but the explicit proof below
   demonstrates two parts of the finite set library. These two parts
   are the tactic [destruct_notin] and the lemma [notin_union], both
   defined in the module [FSetWeakNotin].

   Before stepping through this proof, you should go to that module
   to read about those definitions and see what other finite set
   reasoning is available.

(*************************************************************************)
(** * Opening *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** Opening replaces an index with a term.  It corresponds to informal
    substitution for a bound variable, such as in the rule for beta
    reduction.  Note that only "dangling" indices (those that do not
    refer to any abstraction) can be opened.  Opening has no effect
    for terms that are locally closed.

    Natural numbers are just an inductive datatype with two
    constructors: [O] (as in the letter 'oh', not 'zero') and [S],
    defined in Coq.Init.Datatypes.  Coq allows literal natural numbers
    to be written using standard decimal notation, e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.
    The notation [k == i] is the decidable equality function for
    natural numbers (cf. [Coq.Peano_dec.eq_nat_dec]).  This notation
    is defined in the Metatheory library.

    We make several simplifying assumptions in defining [open_rec].

    First, we assume that the argument [u] is locally closed.  This
    assumption simplifies the implementation since we do not need to
    shift indices in [u] when passing under a binder.  Second, we
    assume that this function is initially called with index zero and
    that zero is the only unbound index in the term.  This eliminates
    the need to possibly subtract one in the case of indices.

    There is no need to worry about variable capture because bound
    variables are indices.
*)

Fixpoint open_rec (k : nat) (u : exp)(e : exp)
  {struct e} : exp :=
  match e with
    | bvar i => if k == i then u else (bvar i)
    | fvar x => fvar x
    | abs t e1 => abs t (open_rec (S k) u e1)
    | app e1 e2 => app (open_rec k u e1) (open_rec k u e2)
  end.

(** Many common applications of opening replace index zero with an
    expression or variable.  The following definition provides a
    convenient shorthand for such uses.  Note that the order of
    arguments is switched relative to the definition above.  For
    example, [(open e x)] can be read as "substitute the variable [x]
    for index [0] in [e]" and "open [e] with the variable [x]."
    Recall that the coercions above let us write [x] in place of
    [(fvar x)].
*)

Definition open e u := open_rec 0 u e.


(** This next demo shows the operation of [open].  For example, the
    locally nameless representation of the term (\y. (\x. (y x)) y) is
    [abs (app (abs (app 1 0)) 0)].  To look at the body without the
    outer abstraction, we need to replace the indices that refer to
    that abstraction with a name.  Therefore, we show that we can open
    the body of the abs above with Y to produce [app (abs (app Y 0))
    Y)].
*)

Lemma demo_open :
  open (app (abs typ_base (app 1 0)) 0) Y =
       (app (abs typ_base (app Y 0)) Y).
Proof.
  unfold open.
  unfold open_rec.
  simpl.
  auto.
Qed.

(* HINT for demo: To show the equality of the two sides below, use the
   tactics [unfold], which replaces a definition with its RHS and
   reduces it to head form, and [simpl], which reduces the term the
   rest of the way.  Then finish up with [auto].  *)

(** * Local closure *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** Recall that [exp] admits terms that contain unbound indices.  We
    say that a term is locally closed when no indices appearing in it
    are unbound.  The proposition [lc e] holds when an expression [e]
    is locally closed.

    The inductive definition below formalizes local closure such that
    the resulting induction principle serves as the structural
    induction principle over (locally closed) expressions.  In
    particular, unlike induction for type [exp], there are no cases
    for bound variables.  Thus, the induction principle corresponds
    more closely to informal practice than the one arising from the
    definition of pre-terms.

(*************************************************************************)

(** We also define a notation for [open_rec] to make stating some of
    the properties simpler. However, we don't need to use open_rec
    outside of this part of the tutorial so we make it a local
    notation, confined to this section. *)

Local Notation "{ k ~> u } t" := (open_rec k u t) (at level 67).

(** The first property we would like to show is the analogue to
    [subst_fresh]: index substitution has no effect for closed terms.

(** At this point there are two problems.  Our goal is about
    substitution for index [S k] in term [e], while our induction
    hypothesis IHLC only tells use about index [k] in term [open e x].

    To solve the first problem, we generalize our IH over all [k].
    That way, when [k] is incremented in the [abs] case, it will still
    apply.  Below, we use the tactic [generalize dependent] to
    generalize over [k] before using induction.

(** At this point we are still stuck because the IH concerns
    [open e x] instead of [e]. The result that we need is that if an
    index substitution has no effect for an opened term, then it has
    no effect for the raw term (as long as we are *not* substituting
    for [0], hence [S k] below).
<<
   open e x = {S k ~> u}(open e x)  -> e = {S k ~> u} e

   In other words, expanding the definition of open:
<<
   {0 ~> x}e = {S k ~> u}({0 ~> x} e)  -> e = {S k ~> u} e
>>
   Of course, to prove this result, we must generalize
   [0] and [S k] to be any pair of inequal numbers to get a strong
   enough induction hypothesis for the [abs] case.

(** Cofinite quantification *)
(*************************************************************************)

(* In the next example, we will reexamine the definition of
   [lc] in the [abs] case.

   The lemma [subst_lc] says that local closure is preserved by
   substitution.  Let's start working through this proof.
*)

Lemma subst_lc_0 : forall (x : atom) u e,
  lc e ->
  lc u ->
  lc ([x ~> u] e).
Proof.
  intros x u e He Hu.
  induction He.
  Case "lc_fvar".
    simpl.
    destruct (x0 == x).
      auto.
      auto.
  Case "lc_abs".
    simpl.
    (* Print lc_abs. *)
    apply lc_abs with (x:=x0).
    apply subst_notin_fv.
    auto.
Admitted.

(** Here we are stuck. We don't know that [x0] is not in the free
    variables of [u].

    The solution is to change the *definition* of local closure so
    that we get a different induction principle.  Currently, in the
    [lc_abs] case, we show that an abstraction is locally closed by
    showing that the body is locally closed after it has been opened
    with one particular variable.

<<
  | lc_abs : forall (x : atom) e,
      x `notin` fv e ->
      lc (open e x) ->
      lc (abs e)
>>

    Therefore, our induction hypothesis in this case only applies to
    that variable. From the hypothesis list in the [lc_abs] case:

      x0 : atom,
      IHHe : lc ([x ~> u]open e x0)

    The problem is that we don't have any assumptions about [x0]. It
    could very well be equal to [x].

    A stronger induction principle provides an IH that applies to many
    variables. In that case, we could pick one that is "fresh enough".
    To do so, we need to revise the above definition of lc and replace
    the type of lc_abs with this one:

<<
  | lc_abs_c : forall L e,
      (forall x:atom, x `notin` L -> lc (open e x)) ->
      lc (abs e)
>>

   This rule says that to show that an abstraction is locally closed,
   we need to show that the body is closed, after it has been opened by
   any atom [x], *except* those in some set [L]. With this rule, the IH
   in this proof is now:

     H0 : forall x0 : atom, x0 `notin` L -> lc ([x ~> u]open e x0)

   Below, lc_c is the local closure judgment revised to use this new
   rule in the abs case. We call this "cofinite quantification"
   because the IH applies to an infinite number of atoms [x0], except
   those in some finite set [L].

   Changing the rule in this way does not change what terms are locally
   closed.  (For more details about cofinite-quantification see:

   Pollack, Weirich. POPL 2008.)

(** * Tactic support *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** When picking a fresh atom or applying a rule that uses cofinite
    quantification, choosing a set of atoms to be fresh for can be
    tedious.  In practice, it is simpler to use a tactic to choose the
    set to be as large as possible.

    The tactic [gather_atoms] is used to collect together all the
    atoms in the context.  It relies on an auxiliary tactic,
    [gather_atoms_with] (from MetatheoryAtom), which maps a function
    that returns a finite set of atoms over all hypotheses with the
    appropriate type.
*)

Ltac gather_atoms ::=
  let A := gather_atoms_with (fun x : atoms => x) in
  let B := gather_atoms_with (fun x : atom => singleton x) in
  let C := gather_atoms_with (fun x : list (atom * typ) => dom x) in
  let D := gather_atoms_with (fun x : exp => fv x) in
  constr:(A `union` B `union` C `union` D).

(** A number of other, useful tactics are defined by the Metatheory
    library, and each depends on [gather_atoms].  By redefining
    [gather_atoms], denoted by the [::=] in its definition below, we
    automatically update these tactics so that they use the proper
    notion of "all atoms in the context."

    For example, the tactic [(pick fresh x)] chooses an atom fresh for
    "everything" in the context.  It is the same as [(pick fresh x for
    L)], except where [L] has been computed by [gather_atoms].

    The tactic [(pick fresh x and apply H)] applies a rule [H] that is
    defined using cofinite quantification.  It automatically
    instantiates the finite set of atoms to exclude using
    [gather_atoms].

(*************************************************************************)
(** * Typing environments *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** We represent environments as association lists (lists of pairs of
    keys and values) whose keys are [atom]s.
*)

Notation env := (list (atom * typ)).

(** For STLC, environments bind [atom]s to [typ]s.  We define an
    abbreviation [env] for the type of these environments.  Coq will
    print [list (atom * typ)] as [env], and we can use [env] as a
    shorthand for writing [list (atom * typ)].

    Lists are defined in Coq's standard library, with the constructors
    [nil] and [cons].  The list library includes the [::] notation
    for cons as well as standard list operations such as append, map,
    and fold. The infix operation "++" is list append.

    The Metatheory library extends this reasoning by instantiating the
    AssocList library to provide support for association lists whose
    keys are [atom]s.  Everything in this library is polymorphic over
    the type of objects bound in the environment.  Look in AssocList
    for additional details about the functions and predicates that we
    mention below.
*)

(** Environment equality *)

(** When reasoning about environments, we often need to talk about
    bindings in the "middle" of an environment. Therefore, it is common
    for lemmas and definitions to use list append in their statements.
    Unfortunately, list append is associative, so two Coq expressions may
    denote the same environment even though they are not equal.

    The tactic [simpl_env] reassociates all concatenations of
    environments to the right.
*)

(** To make environments easy to read, instead of building them from

    components:
      - [nil]: The empty list.
      - [one]: Lists consisting of exactly one item.
      - [++]:  List append.

   Furthermore, we introduce compact notation for one (singleton lists):
   [(x ~ T)] is the same as [one (x, T)].
*)

(** The simpl_env tactic actually puts lists built from only nil, one
    and [++] into a "normal form". This process reassociates all appends
    to the right, removes extraneous nils converts cons to singleton
    lists with an append.
*)

    tactic [rewrite_env].

    environment is [uniq].  The structure of typing derivations
    implicitly ensures that the relation holds only for locally closed
    expressions.  Finally, note the use of cofinite quantification in
    the [typing_abs] case.

(** * Weakening *)
(*************************************************************************)

(** Weakening states that if an expression is typeable in some
    environment, then it is typeable in any well-formed extension of
    that environment.  This property is needed to prove the
    substitution lemma.

    As stated below, this lemma is not directly proveable.  The
    natural way to try proving this lemma proceeds by induction on the
    typing derivation for [e].
*)

  induction H; eauto.
  Case "typing_abs_c".
    pick fresh x and apply typing_abs_c.
    (* ... stuck here ... *)
Admitted.

(** We are stuck in the [typing_abs_c] case because the induction
    hypothesis [H0] applies only when we weaken the environment at its
    head.  In this case, however, we need to weaken the environment in
    the middle; compare the conclusion at the point where we're stuck
    to the hypothesis [H], which comes from the given typing derivation.

    We can obtain a more useful induction hypothesis by changing the
    statement to insert new bindings into the middle of the
    environment, instead of at the head.  However, the proof still
    gets stuck, as can be seen by examining each of the cases in
    the proof below.

    Note: To view subgoal n in a proof, use the command "[Show n]".
    To work on subgoal n instead of the first one, use the command
    "[Focus n]".

Lemma typing_weakening_strengthened_0 : forall (E F G : env) e T,

  Case "typing_abs_c".
    (* The [typing_abs_c] case still does not have a strong enough IH. *)
Admitted.

(** The hypotheses in the [typing_var_c] case include an environment
    [E0] that that has no relation to what we need to prove.  The
    missing fact we need is that [E0 = (G ++ E)].

    The problem here arises from the fact that Coq's [induction]
    tactic let's us only prove something about all typing derivations.
    While it's clear to us that weakening applies to all typing
    derivations, it's not clear to Coq, because the environment is
    written using concatenation.  The [induction] tactic expects that
    all arguments to a judgement are variables.  So we see [E0] in the
    proof instead of [(G ++ E)].

    The solution is to restate the lemma.  For example, we can prove

<<
  forall E F E' e T, typing_c E' e T ->
  forall G, E' = G ++ E -> uniq (G ++ F ++ E) -> typing_c (G ++ F ++ E) e T.
>>

    The equality gets around the problem with Coq's [induction]
    tactic.  The placement of the [(forall G)] quantifier gives us a
    sufficiently strong induction hypothesis in the [typing_abs_c] case.

    However, we prefer not to state the lemma in the way shown above,
    since it is not as readable as the original statement.  Instead,
    we use a tactic to introduce the equality within the proof itself.
    The tactic [(remember t as t')] replaces an object [t] with the
    identifier [t'] everywhere in the goal and introduces an equality
    [t' = t] into the context.  It is often combined with [generalize
    dependent], as illustrated below.
