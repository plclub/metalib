(** * Cofinite quantification *)

(** Consider a rule [H] (equivalently, constructor, lemma, etc.) whose
    type begins with [forall L, ...] and contains hypotheses of the
    form [(forall y, y `notin` L -> ...)].

    The tactic [(pick fresh x excluding F and apply H)] applies [H] to
    the current goal, instantiating [H]'s first argument ([L]) with
    the finite set of atoms [F].  In each new subgoal of the form
    [(forall y, y `notin` F -> ...)], the atom [y] is introduced as
    [x], and [(y `notin` F)] is introduced using a generated name.

    If we view [H] as a rule that uses cofinite quantification, the
    tactic can be read as picking a sufficiently fresh atom to open a
    term with. *)

  :=

    returned by the [gather_atoms] tactic.  Redefine [gather_atoms] if
    you wish to modify the behavior of this tactic. *)

(** * Hints *)

(** The next block of hints is to help [auto] discharge many of the
    inequality and freshness goals that arise in programming language
    metatheory proofs.

    Implementation note (BEA): The [eassumption] step is intended to
    address those cases where [eauto] tries to use a cofinite
    rule. The pattern goes something like this:

      - Apply a cofinite rule with no idea what "[L]" should be.
        This adds a hypothesis [x `notin` ?1] to the context.
      - Apply the IH.
      - [eassumption] resolves the [x `notin` L] obligation of
        the IH against the previously introduced [x `notin` ?1]
        hypothesis.

    This ensures that the [autorewrite] step does not trigger an
    infinite loop. *)
